# PhiziBox
PhiziBox is an open-source sandbox physics simulator program (still during development)

This program is not comlete and there is lots of things that I have to do
This program doesn't even have a spawn bodies window(there is one but I am still making it)
you can just spawn windows by keys on the keyboard now and you can't set their size without editing the code

controls:

press r for a rectangle body
press p for a polygon body(you can edit vertices in the code but it has to be > 2, <= 16)
press c for a circle body
press s for small circles(made them just for fun they are really laggy in big numbers)
